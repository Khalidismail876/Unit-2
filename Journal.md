### Evaluation of Bash and Arduino
Arduino is more simpler than bash. When it comes to coding, arduino seems to be easier and more understandable,
while bash is a little bit complicated. One thing that makes Arduino more easeir is that the coding syntax is more relatable
to other coding program like C++. But Bash has an advantage over Arduino, which is that you can use it anytime you want 
since its linked in your terminal. if you compare the varibales in Bash and Arduino, it feels like that Arduino's varaibles is
a little bit complicated than Bash. Overall, Arduino is a better coding system for me at least. 



### Reflection 1

We started learning about arduino programmaning first,
and we practiced how to do a basic coding for arduino.
after we practiced a little bit, we started using arduino for binary code.
We have been learning and making codes for the binary numbers,
We made a program that converts decimal to binary.
We have also learned a binary reading, where 
we convert the binary to expression which then helped us create 
a code for it.

I feel like the classes have been fun since we had to use actual tools 
that led us create something like a traffic light. Also not using the computer all the time 
inside the class was a great help and I had the chance to do binary convertion with my own hands. 

Question: When are we going to start dividing teams to develope the communication system for the planets?

### Reflection 2

We were talking about how to use the two button that is provided for our Marcial decode 
we discussed how we need to use this two button so that we can let the users have easier time communicating with 
other people
We have also learn Usibility and discoveribility feedback
these are the way which the designers need to think when they are making their software

Question :  When is the project for unit 2 due?

### Reflection 3
We practiced on how to convert binary numbers into both hexadecimal and decimal. We have also 
went through a doc where we filled our a code that meant to use a metrix system to create 
communication system. It looks like we are almost done with the binary section and we will start 
the morse code. I think, classes have been ok so far, I'm just wondering when are we starting to work 
with the teams that we assigned?


### Reflection 4
We have been coding for arduino in order to finish the communication project. We have divided each other 
into different teams and for each team we dicided to plan what our processs is going to be. We have spent 
the entire class planning for the sets of the project. Now we finished setting all our plans, we are going to 
start coding for it. 
Question: how long do we have to finish the project?

### Reflection 5
Today we spend the entire day coding the project and it looks like we made some progress to finishing it. We 
have communicated with the other members in the class to see where their progress is going and its going pretty 
smooth with them as they stated. Now; we just need to keep coding and finish it before the deadline.

### Reflection 6
since we came back from the break, we thought that we will be working on the project but today's class we have started 
doing a new language. This language is called C programming, and it looks a bit easier than the other two languages 
that we learned before. I like all the feedbacks I get when I make a mistake and fixing it the mistakes are pretty simple.
Question: are we going to have more time doing the arduino in class?
